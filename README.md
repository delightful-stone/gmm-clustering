Simple visualization of how EM algorithm could be use for Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. You will need matlab to run the code.
Modify datapath variable to use another dataset, and modify variable K to change the number of cluster.

Feature work:
- interactive plot where you can pick a distribution to generate the data
